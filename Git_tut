This file is for learning git
git is distributed version control
this file is working directory
to make git track this file we need to add this file to staging area
and also we can track commit history

first we need to create a git repository for local
agar dusri time bapis commit karna hai tho uske liya bapis se ye file add karni padegi staging area me


git init -b main ---  is used to add git repository for local device with name main
git status --- is used to see the status of what we are doing in git
git add name --- is used to add file to staging area.
git commit -m "message" --- is used to commit git file
git log --- to see commit history


-- Next thing is how to see what all changes we are doing in file

git diff -- it is used for this purpose.

-- Next thing is if we add some file in staged area which should not be there so we must remove it

git rm --cached filename
